### 4. How Projects Work

In this section, the process for creating projects is described. This explains the contractual relationship between creators and NFT
holders (or backers). By using CrowdFund NFT, both in the capacity of a creator or backer, you agree to the process and responsibilities
outlined in this section.

CrowdFund NFT is a platform for funding projects. A project is an invitation for backers to form a contract with a creator. Anyone who backs
a project accepts the creator’s contract. Similarly, creators have a responsibility to uphold their contractual obligations with backers.

CrowdFund NFT is not a part of this contract - the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and NFt holders, or backers. Here are
the legal terms that govern agreements between creators and backers:

When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill rewards. Once a creator has done so, they have satisfied
their obligation to their backers.

Creators owe backers honest communication throughout the project’s lifecycle, and dedication to complete the project in the allocated time frame.
Equally, backers must understand that they are helping to support a new project. This means that there may be delays and changes to projects and
their timeline - and there is a chance that something prevents a project from being completed.

If a creator cannot complete a project, and / or does not provide rewards to backers, they have failed to live up to their obligations to backers.
Creators must take every reasonable effort to remedy the situation. A creator in this situation has only remedied the situation if they:
- Contact backers to explain what work has been done, how funds were used and what has prevented them from completing the project.
- Commit to bringing the project to the best possible conclusion that satisfies backers
- Are able to demonstrate that funds were used appropriately and every effort was made to complete the project.
- Are able to demonstrate that no material misrepresentations were made during the crowdfunding round.
- Offer to return remaining funds to backers who have not received their rewards.

Creators are solely responsible for completing their project, and providing backers with rewards. If they are unable to satisfy
the terms of their agreement with backers, they may be subject to legal action by backers.

### 5. How Funding Works
This section covers the process for backing a project. It details how money gets collected, what happens when projects get
fully funded, or don’t get fully funded, the role of NFT’s in the backing &amp; rewards process, and contact processes for
creators to get in touch with backers and provide rewards.

When you back a project:
- You are transferring ICP tokens into a CrowdFund NFT owned Escrow wallet. To do this, you have to allow access for your PlugWallet, or another Crypto wallet, through the platform. Your payment will be collected - but not delivered to the project creator until the project has reached its fundraising goal. If the project does not reach its funding goal, the ICP tokens will be transferred back into your wallet, minus transaction fees (0.001 ICP).
- You cannot change or cancel your pledge before the project’s funding deadline.
- Your NFT will be transferred to your wallet if and when the project meets its fundraising goal. The NFT will not be transferred until the project deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, you will not receive an NFT, but your ICP tokens will simply be reimbursed.
- The creator may need to contact you or ask questions to deliver rewards. We ask project creators to send us links to both their personal and project Discord channels, which we make available on the project page, on our website. To contact creators, or for them to contact you - our recommended method is through Discord, although creators and backers are free to communicate through any medium.

When you create a project:
- If you reach your project goal, you will receive the amount raised, minus our fees and transaction fees, after the deadline. If you have not reached your fundraising goal by the deadline, you will not receive any of the amount raised - as it will be reimbursed to backers.
- We will deduct our fees before transferring the ICP tokens into your wallet. We charge a 5% fee on the amount raised.
- Your NFT collection represents a contract between you and backers. NFT’s will be released to backers if the project reaches its fundraising goal, after the deadline. With ownership of these NFT’s comes a right from backers to claim their rewards from you. You are responsible for delivering rewards to backers, and for contacting them if required.

### 6. NFT sales on Secondary Marketplaces

As a backer, who holds NFT’s generated through CrowdFund NFT, you are entitled to sell your NFT’s on secondary marketplaces.
However, once you sell the NFT, buyers on secondary marketplaces are now legally entitled to rewards that have not already been
delivered. The contract between you and the project creator is now transferred to the new NFT holder - this because, the legal
agreement rests between project creator and NFT holders.

Once NFT’s reach secondary marketplaces, there is a transfer of the contractual agreement between backers and creators. The only
legally binding contract with regards to rewards exists between creators and NFT holders, secondary NFT owners and buyers collect
rights to all rewards that have not yet been delivered. This means that creators are obliged to provide rewards to secondary NFT owners.

Secondary market fees:

CrowdFund NFT charges a fee for selling NFT’s minted by CrowdFund NFT on secondary marketplaces. The “Royalty” fee will depend on the
marketplace where the NFT is sold. In most cases, we will charge the maximum fee that the platform allows. To find out what this fee is,
please visit the Terms of the NFT Marketplace you are using to resell NFT’s. 

### 7. User Conduct

All users on CrowdFund NFT must not: break the law, lie, commit abuse, steal data or hack people’s accounts etc. We require appropriate and
honest behaviour from our users - this applies both to creators and backers.

We expect all users on CrowdFund NFT, both creators and backers to:

- Not break the law. This means taking actions that infringe or violate the law, or breaches any contract or legal obligation that users have with other parties.
- Not lie. Do not post information that is false, either about yourself or a project. Do not post information that is misleading or can be considered deceptive. This may be subject to review for fraudulent activity.
- Not offer illegal rewards. Any rewards that are illegal or violate CrowdFund NFT’s policies are prohibited. We will review rewards to make sure they don’t violate our legal and ethical codes of conduct - but rewards that are considered illegal could be subject to legal action.
- Don’t steal or abuse other people&#39;s personal information. You may receive information concerning backers or creators - their contact details, their personal information, names, emails, discord accounts, etc. This information is confidential and if abused or stolen may be subject to legal action.


### 8. Responsibilities

Crowdfund NFT is not responsible for the performance of projects - or for mediation between creators and backers.

CrowdFund NFT is not legally liable or responsible for any damages relating to use of services - we are not responsible for disputes between creators and brackets, nor are we responsible for disputes with third party services. Content submitted to the website is not endorsed by CrowdFund NFT. All content and actions on the platform are performed at the users risk - this applies to both creators and backers.

### 9. Fees

We charge a 5% fee on successfully funded projects, in addition to Internet Computer transaction fees. We also charge a flat fee of 1 ICP to submit a project for review. For NFT’s sold on secondary marketplaces, that were minted by CrowdFund NFT, we also charge a royalty fee, which will vary depending on the marketplace the NFT is sold on.

Browsing CrowdFund NFT is free. Creating an account is also free.

If you would like to submit a project for review, we charge a flat fee of 1 ICP. This fee is charged at the point of submission, and it does not guarantee that your project will go live - it serves as a “review” fee. If your project does go live, we will collect the fee. If the project does not go live, the fee will be reimbursed to the respective wallet.

If your project is successfully funded, we will charge a 5% fee on the amount raised, in addition to ICP transaction fees. If your project is unsuccessfully funded, backers will be reimbursed and no additional fees will be charged, only ICP transaction fees.

For NFT’s that were minted by CrowdFund NFT, and sold by backers on secondary marketplaces, we charge a royalty fee for all NFT’s sold. The fee will vary depending on the marketplace the NFT’s are sold on. To find out this fee, please visit the terms of the NFT marketplace you intend to sell NFT’s, and find their designated royalty fee for NFT minters.


### 10. Other websites and Third Parties
