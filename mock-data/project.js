    story: `We are launching a crowdfunding round to help support Ukrainian families in need of humanitarian assistance, in light of the devastating war happening in the Ukraine.

    We will donate 100% of the amount collected to the UK UNHCR, in the hope of helping the agency increase their efforts with their work to support families who are fleeing war zone areas, as well as families whose homes have been destroyed by the war.
    
    To explore the work of the UK UNHCR, in particular with regards to their work in the Ukraine, please visit their website: https://www.unrefugees.org.uk/take-action/how-to-help-ukraine/
    
    We hope that the IC community can get behind this great cause - to help people who are suffering from the consequences of war. `,
